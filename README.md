Projects using PCBwiz, Keil, Proteus<br />
PCB Wizard:<br />
PCB Wizard is a powerful package for designing single-sided and double-sided printed circuit boards (PCBs).<br />
It provides a comprehensive range of tools covering all the traditional steps in PCB production, including schematic drawing, schematic capture, component placement, automatic routing, Bill of Materials reporting, and file generation for manufacturing.

KEIL:<br />
Keil accurately simulates on-chip peripherals (IÂ²C, CAN, UART, SPI, Interrupts, I/O Ports, A/D Converter, D/A Converter, and PWM Modules) of your 8051 device.

Proteus:<br />
The Proteus Design Suite is used primarily for electronic design automation. It is used as a cost-effective solution for professional PCB design and as a rapid prototyping tool for R&D.
